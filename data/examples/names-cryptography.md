# Change names used in cryptography

In cryptography names are often used to represent users and different ways of attack strategies. The best known are Bob and Alice. However the list extends to a lot more examples. Those tend to assign mostly female names to negatively annotated roles, furthering a bias among readers. Consider using animals instead. This gives the additional benefit of animals being associated with stereotypical traits, that can be utilized. A color changing chameleon might give the student an easier association to a user with many fraudulent profiles, than ‘Sybil’.  

If you prefer to remain with names, perhaps be aware on the balance of male and female names used in positive and negative contexts and the balance of male and female names overall. Furthermore be aware that the established names tend to be very western.
