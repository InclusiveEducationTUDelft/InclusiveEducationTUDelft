## Glossary Documentation

### Introduction

The glossary terms are located in the `public/data/glossary.json` file. This file contains a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a term along with its corresponding definition. The glossary is utilized throughout the project to provide quick reference information and context for various terms.

### Glossary Structure

Each glossary entry is represented as an object with the following structure:

```
{
    "term": "Term Name",
    "definition": "A detailed explanation of the term."
}
``` 

-   **term**: The name of the term (string).
-   **definition**: The explanation or definition of the term (string).

### Location of the Glossary

The glossary data can be found in the `public/data/glossary.json` file. To update or modify the glossary, follow the steps below.

### Adding a Glossary Term

To add a new term to the glossary, follow these steps:

1.  Open the `glossary.json` file located in `public/data/`.
2.  Add a new entry to the JSON array in the following format:

```
{
    "term": "New Term",
    "definition": "A concise and comprehensive explanation for the new term."
}
``` 

3.  Save the file and ensure it is correctly formatted by using a JSON validator such as [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/).

### Editing a Glossary Term

To edit an existing glossary term:

1.  Locate the term in the `glossary.json` file.
2.  Modify the `term` or `definition` field as needed.
3.  Save the file and validate the JSON format using a linter if necessary.

### Removing a Glossary Term

To remove a glossary term:

1.  Delete the corresponding object from the JSON array in the `glossary.json` file.
2.  Save the file and ensure the JSON remains valid.

### Example Glossary Content

Here is an example of a few glossary terms formatted as JSON:

```
[
    {
        "term": "A Term 1",
        "definition": "A comprehensive explanation about the first term that starts with the letter A, involving various aspects and technical details of the subject matter."
    },
    {
        "term": "A Term 2",
        "definition": "A second definition for a different term that begins with A, exploring the broader context in which this term is often used, along with examples from practical applications."
    },
    {
        "term": "B Term 1",
        "definition": "A description of the first term starting with B, delving into its origin, its impact on modern practices, and its relevance to current industry standards."
    }
]
``` 

### Important Considerations

-   **JSON Format**: The `glossary.json` file must be properly formatted as JSON, with each entry separated by a comma, and the entire list wrapped in square brackets (`[]`).
-   **File Location**: Ensure that the `glossary.json` file is always located in the `public/data/` directory.
-   **Validation**: Use a JSON validator like [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/) to ensure that the `glossary.json` file is properly formatted, especially after adding or removing entries.

### Glossary Integration

The glossary terms are used across the application to provide contextual information and definitions for users. These terms are automatically populated in the UI based on the contents of the `glossary.json` file.

For more information on how to integrate the glossary terms into your UI components, refer to the `src/glossary/Glossary.tsx` file.
