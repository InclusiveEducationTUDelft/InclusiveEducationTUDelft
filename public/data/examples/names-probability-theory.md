# Gendered names in Probability Theory 

Gender representation and gender-neutral names can be applied in probability theory. 

## Example 1 - A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics (Book) 
Instead of using examples such as John and Mary, this can be generalized by using, for example, person A and person B instead.  

## Example 2: Probability: An introduction (book), (11.7, page 200) 

In some exercises about identical robots, the names that are given are all male. This can be more inclusive by given them gender-neutral names.  

## Female role model in probability theory:  

Florence Nightingale David wrote the books Probability Theory for Statistical Methods and Games, Gods and Gambling.  
Julia Robinson worked on decision problems for rings and fields, while also working on Hilbertâ€™s Tenth Problem. https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Robinson_Julia/
