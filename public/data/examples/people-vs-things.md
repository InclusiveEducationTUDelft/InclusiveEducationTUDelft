# People rather than things appeal more to women
On average, women demonstrate a stronger preference for activities involving people, while men tend to be more inclined toward tasks involving things. This can improve the appeal of STEM education to women, particularly in computing.

Currently, women are underrepresented in STEM fields. Lippa's research established that gender differences align with preferences on the people-things spectrum, with women showing greater interest in people-oriented tasks. Building on this, Christensen and Marcher looked at this relationship in computing educational activities. They explored these preferences in computing education among Danish high school students. They found that the the odds of a woman preferring a task involving people is 2.7 times higher than those of a man. Additionally, the odds of a student without self proclaimed prior programming experience preferring a task involving people is 1.4 times higher than those of with experience.  
Christensen and Marcher extended their research to IT University of Copenhagen students, focusing on first-year participants in the mandatory Introductory Programming course. Students were given a choice between people-oriented or things-oriented versions of similar assignments. Women demonstrated a clear preference for the people-tasks, while male students seemed to be indifferent or slightly preferred the same. The strength of preferences depended on the task at hand, and there is considerable variation between students.

Christensen and Marcher suggest educators to consider favoring themes involving people over those involving things in computing educational activities, as it appears to increase the appeal of the activities to women. As there is individual differences in the preferences, they suggest providing students with both types of assignments, people and things, to accommodate this variation. 
Examples on how to make computing assignments about people instead of things:
* Employee system salary rather than storage system pricing
* Hotel booking rather than cargo ship booking
* Customer tracker rather than electricity tracker
