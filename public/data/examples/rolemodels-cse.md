# Female rolemodels in Computer Science

Computer Science has long featured male role models, but showcasing women in STEM can inspire and empower more women in the field. This list aims to provide examples of women in STEM, that can be highlighted!

## Systems
* **Radia Perlman:** She was Inventor of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), hence also called the 'Mother of the Internet' 
* **NIAC Six** – Comprised of six women, Betty Holberton, Jean Jennings Bartik, Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichhterman and Frances Bilas Spence, who programmed the world's first modern computer  

## Models
* **Joan Clarke** – She worked together with Alan Turing on the Engima project to decrypt the messages of the german military 

## Software
* **Grace Hopper:** Grace Hopper's team at Remington Rand wrote the compiler for the A-0 programming language (and coined the term compiler to describe it) 
She was also part of the team that found a moth in their computer leading to issues, hence forming a stepping stone to the term debugging. 
* **Margaret Hamilton** – She was an American computer scientist and software engineer who worked on flight software for NASA's Apollo program, she coined the term software engineer
