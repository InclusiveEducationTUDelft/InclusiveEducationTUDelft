# Female rolemodels in Computer Science

Computer Science has long featured male role models, but showcasing women in STEM can inspire and empower more women in the field. This list aims to provide examples of women in STEM, that can be highlighted!

## Systems
* **Radia Perlman:** She was Inventor of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), hence also called the 'Mother of the Internet'.
* **NIAC Six** – Comprised of six women, Betty Holberton, Jean Jennings Bartik, Kay McNulty, Marlyn Wescoff Meltzer, Ruth Lichhterman and Frances Bilas Spence, who programmed the world's first modern computer.
* **Hedy Lamarr** - She was an Austrian born actress. Despite having no formal training she co-invented a radio guidance system using frequency hopping which is considered a foundation for modern wireless connection technologies.
* **Sophie Mary Wilson** - She is an English trans-woman who co-designed the ARM architecture, thus making her a significant contributor to microprocessor electronics.

## Models
* **Joan Clarke** – She worked together with Alan Turing on the Engima project to decrypt the messages of the german military.

## Software
* **Grace Hopper:** Grace Hopper's team at Remington Rand wrote the compiler for the A-0 programming language (and coined the term compiler to describe it).
She was also part of the team that found a moth in their computer leading to issues, hence forming a stepping stone to the term debugging. 
* **Margaret Hamilton** – She was an American computer scientist and software engineer who worked on flight software for NASA's Apollo program, she coined the term software engineer. 
* **Ada Lovelace** - She was a British Mathematician who has been refered to as the first computer programmer, for having written a program on a prototype of a digital computer.
* **Barbara Liskov** - She pioneered contributions to programming languages awarding her with the 2008 Turing award. Her work in compiler optimization includes the introduction of abstract data types and data abstration, as well as the Liskov substitution principle (LSP).
* **Frances Allen** - Her work in abstraction and compiler opimization awarded her the 2006 Turing award making her the first woman to do so. Her work included optimizing programs and parallel computing to improve compilers, thus aiming to make programming in high-level languages more attractive and thus programming at large more accessible.

## Data & AI
* **Karen Spärck Jones** - She was a self-taught computer scientist, who worked on the inverse document frequency (IDF), which is used in most modern search engines. Her work contributed to the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing.
