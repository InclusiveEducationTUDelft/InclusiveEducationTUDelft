# Alcohol mentions
Try not to mention alcohol-specific examples when teaching, as it may feel exclusive towards specific religious or cultural groups.

When mentioning having a drink outside of class, keep it general, thus including both non-alcohol and alcohol consumers. 

Did you know that the likelihood of alcohol consumption is lower for more religious people? If you want to read more on the relation between religion and alcohol, read [this paper by Gayle](https://doi.org/10.1080/07448480903380250).
